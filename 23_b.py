	23. Define a simple "spelling correction" function `correct()` 
	that takes a string and sees to it that: 
	1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, 
	2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter.
	E.g. `correct("This   is  very funny  and    cool.Indeed!")` 
	should return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!" Tip: Use regular expressions!
